# Deploying NodeJS Application and Monitoring the App with Prometheus and Grafana

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to deploy and monitor a simple Node.js application on Kubernetes. Using Prometheus and Grafana, we can collect metrics, set up alerts, and visualize application performance in real-time.

covers the full workflow: 
 - Building a Docker image for the Node.js app
 - Deploying it to Kubernetes with a scalable setup
 - Exposing metrics via Prometheus
 - Creating alerts with PrometheusRules
 - Sending notifications through Alertmanager (Slack integration)
 - Visualizing everything in Grafana dashboards
